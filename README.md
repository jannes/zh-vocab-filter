# ZH-Vocab-Filter
A desktop app for quickly filtering word lists, categorizing words as:

- to study
- not to study
- always ignore

I use this app to create vocabulary lists for books I want to read.
A json file with per chapter vocabulary is used as input,
all filter information is saved in the same file.

Filtered vocabulary (words to study) can be exported as text file,
per chapter or for a selection of multiple chapters.
One can also export all ignored words for bookkeeping.
